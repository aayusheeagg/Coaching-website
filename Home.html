<b>
"Education is the single most important tool that shapes mankind".</b><br>
A unique concept was born i.e. "Ayushmaan Group of Educational Institutions 
with an Intention & commitment to provide result oriented quality education.<br>
25 years ago a teacher set out to make a difference in the lives of students. His passion to train weakest of minds to crack toughest of exams, brought him unparallel laurels. With his growing recognition as distinguished educationist, he committed himself to bring out indias students. It was established in 2005 by<font color="#000000"> Dr. M.K.Tyagi.</font>The institution has a host of academic institutions under its umbrella.<br>
Ever since Ayushmaan began it has been growing at a remarkable pace. It was the visionary zeal of founder chairman Dr. M.K.Tyagi, a gold medallist and renowned academician that led to the setting up of a coaching centre in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh, which was the precursor for this institute. </p>

<span class="there">
Our expertise being nice education, we plan to begin in Saharanpur with a specific nice module which is directed at students who are highly likely to display the potential for success at IIT-JEE/AIEEE level competitive exams after class 10 and therefore are encouraged by their parents to join a good coaching centre, but their likelihood of success recedes astonishingly because they get bogged down.<br><br>
In any batch of students it is not difficult to map out skill, talent and competitiveness. There are a bunch of students who score extremely well in all areas consistently through their later schooling years, the proverbial first benchers.<br>
Then there are the proverbial backbenchers.<br>
There is no proverb for the middle benchers.
We are interested in them. </span>

<p> <span class="here">What is Different About Us?</span><br><br>
 We're not a coaching class for one!! We are career builders.<br>
Ayushmaan Classes is perhaps the only institute that has been started by IITians and has IITians as faculty members.
We have faculty members who are Engineers and Scientists from IIT Delhi, IIT Roorkee, D.U etc.
Our faculty is a blend of Experienced and Young team members. Our team of dedicated teachers consists of Young Highly Experienced College Professors and the whole team is extremely inclined to teaching.
Most of our faculty is not just from the IIT we also have very Specialized Faculty from other reputed colleges also.
We're a highly motivated group of teachers and educationists committed to raising the standards of education in the state.Preparing students today for tomorrow's workforce has a lot to do with teaching about how to use and evaluate knowledge.</p>
